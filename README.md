# 02_challenge_refactor_code
 My first challenge in the coding boot camp was asking me to refactor the given code. Before, the code had some debugging and was unorganized. In this challenge, I learned that it's important for code to be clear for other developers to review my code. Also, I learned that adding comments is very important for a developer to give clear code.
